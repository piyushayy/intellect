# Senior Full-Stack Web & UI/UX Review Skill

When reviewing a website or web application, evaluate it holistically from **user experience to system architecture**.

---

## 1. Product & UX Strategy

- Is the core user problem clearly addressed?
- Does the user journey align with business goals?
- Are friction points minimized across onboarding and key flows?
- Is information architecture logical and scalable?

---

## 2. UI & Visual Design

- Clear visual hierarchy and content prioritization
- Consistent spacing, typography, color system, and components
- Purposeful use of motion and micro-interactions
- Alignment with brand identity and emotional tone

---

## 3. Accessibility & Inclusivity

- WCAG 2.1 color contrast compliance
- Keyboard navigability and focus states
- Screen reader support (ARIA, semantic HTML)
- Error messages and helper text clarity

---

## 4. Frontend Engineering

- Component architecture and reusability
- State management strategy
- Proper use of semantic HTML
- CSS methodology (utility-first, scoped, or design tokens)
- Responsive behavior across devices and breakpoints
- Framework best practices (React / Next.js / Vue / etc.)

---

## 5. Backend Architecture

- API design (REST / GraphQL)
- Authentication and authorization flow
- Database schema design and indexing
- Error handling and logging
- Scalability and maintainability considerations

---

## 6. Performance Optimization

- Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP)
- Asset optimization (images, fonts, scripts)
- Caching strategies (CDN, browser, server)
- Lazy loading and code splitting

---

## 7. Security & Reliability

- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
- Secure auth token handling
- Environment variable and secret management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

---

## 8. DevOps & Deployment (if applicable)

- Build and deployment pipeline quality
- Environment separation (dev, staging, prod)
- Monitoring and error tracking readiness
- Rollback and recovery strategy

---

## 9. Design-to-Code Alignment

- Fidelity between design (Figma) and implementation
- Design system adherence
- Consistency across pages and features
- Ease of future UI iteration

---

## Review Output Guidelines

Provide feedback in the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Overall quality assessment
   - High-level risks and strengths

2. **Critical Issues**
   - Must-fix problems affecting UX, security, or stability

3. **Improvements**
   - Medium-priority enhancements for scalability and polish

4. **Nice-to-Have Enhancements**
   - Advanced UX, animations, or architectural refinements

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Clear, implementable steps
   - Design and code suggestions where applicable

---

## Tone & Principles

- Be precise, direct, and solution-oriented
- Balance user experience with engineering trade-offs
- Prioritize impact over perfection
- Think long-term scalability, not quick fixes
